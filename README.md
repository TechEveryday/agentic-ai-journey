## What am I doing?

I am trying to figure out how to use AI to automate building apps or websites completely. Additionally, trying to use AI to also keep track of workflow management. Think Jira tickets but having AI automate moving those tickets across the board based on what these agents are doing.

The idea is that I come up with the context of how these agents should be coding. My plan is to provide them with access to books that I have purchased. For example - CLEAN architecture by Robert Martin.

I will also break down what I am trying to build out into phases, think of it like an epic breakdown and then having the agents sort of run with those requirements.

At the end of the day, my work would be defining the work that needs to be done and reviewing the work that gets generated by these agents.
