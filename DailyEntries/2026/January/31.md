# Day2
Well I have an internal package orchestrator that I named `cid`. Cid is a fictional character in Final Fantasy that was a super smart dude. My first interaction with this character was in Final Fantasy X and Kingdom Hearts.

Paid $5 to get access to use Claude from the cli. Now I just need to figure out how to properly write the yml files to create the task that I'm trying to achieve. Let's see how it goes.

Welp. I blew threw $3 worth of tokens and was not able to get claude to successfully create a calculator app. It worked fine for subtraction, multiplication and division. When it came to addition, it treated it as a string concatenation instead. Additionally, when the orchestrator that I had created was constantly hitting max iterations and doing the same falsey solution.

Final thoughts for today, going back to using AI as a pair programming buddy, and a tool and not something that can generate me something from complete scratch correctly. Also, cursor free plan gets eaten up too quickly and requires to have the paid version to even use the other models that I have already purchased.
