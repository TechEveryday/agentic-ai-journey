Well I have an internal package orchestrator that I named `cid`. Cid is a fictional character in Final Fantasy that was a super smart dude. My first interaction with this character was in Final Fantasy X and Kingdom Hearts.

Paid $5 to get access to use Claude from the cli. Now I just need to figure out how to properly write the yml files to create the task that I'm trying to achieve. Let's see how it goes.

Welp. I blew threw $3 worth of tokens and was not able to get claude to successfully create a calculator app. It worked fine for subtraction, multiplication and division. When it came to addition, it treated it as a string concatenation instead. Additionally, when the orchestrator that I had created was constantly hitting max iterations and doing the same falsey solution.
